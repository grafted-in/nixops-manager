# A NixOps Wrapper for Git Projects
# ---------------------------------
# Modified from repo: https://github.com/grafted-in/nixops-manager
# This assumes there is a file ./stage/stage.nixops where this state is being stored.
#
# Use `./manage --help` to see normal NixOps help.
# Use `./manage {deployment} command` to user normal NixOps commands.
# Use `./manage {deployment} .shell` to open a Nix shell where the environment is set up to use
# `nixops` directly with the same behavior as running `./manage` commands.
